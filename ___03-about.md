My name is Filip Christoffersson and I’m a hybrid designer/developer, living in Jönköping.
I got into webdevelopent about 6 years ago when I was in my last year of High school.
But at this time it was just fooling around with H1 tags and document structure.

And then I did'nt touch any code for 3 years, but I thought to myself that I would test mry skills and
joined a distance course at Linnéuniversitetet and found that jolly appetite once more.
I figured I wanted to follow the white rabbit down the hole, so I applyed for Graphic design and communication @ Södra Vätterbygdens folkhögskola.
Although alot of the topics were more focused on print, I felt that the web and I was a match made in heaven.

Now almost 6 years since I first touched the web, I eat javascript for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And I love it!
