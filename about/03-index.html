            <p>My name is Filip Christoffersson and I’m a hybrid designer/developer, living in Jönköping.
            I got into webdevelopent about 6 years ago when I was in my last year of High school.
            But at this time it was just fooling around with H1 tags and document structure.</p>

            <p>And then I did'nt touch any code for 3 years, but I thought to myself that I would test mry skills and
            joined a distance course at Linnéuniversitetet and found that jolly appetite once more.
            I figured I wanted to follow the white rabbit down the hole, so I applyed for Graphic design and communication @ Södra Vätterbygdens folkhögskola.
            Although alot of the topics were more focused on print, I felt that the web and I was a match made in heaven.</p>

            <p>Now almost 6 years since I first touched the web, I eat javascript for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And I love it!</p>
