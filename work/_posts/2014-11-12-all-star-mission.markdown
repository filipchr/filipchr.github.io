During my internship @ LOFT Reklambyrå in Jönköping I was handed my own account, All Star Mission.
All Star Mission is a organisation under Pingst Jönkping that arranges sportsevent for young folks such as streethockey, floorball, soccer and FIFA-tournaments.

All Star Mission wanted a new suit and the result was a new logo and a new website.

The main goal with the website was to make it accessable from any device and easy to use, unlike the previous site.

[Allstarmission.se](http://allstarmission.se) is built opon Wordpress for the backend, and for the front-end the site is based opon [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
