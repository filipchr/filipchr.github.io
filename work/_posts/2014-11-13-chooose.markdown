Have you ever wanted to do something, but could not do it because there was nobody can make up their mind?

Well, I had that problem and thought I hade to do something fun with that thought. So, I created [chooo.se](http://chooo.se)!

The site is a simple strawpoll app, in the design phase I couldn't find any simular app that was kind to the eye, and user friendly.

The version that is online as of today [2014-11-19], is just an [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and some more changes is in the pipeline.

Chooo.se is built upon [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) for the backend and is designed as an API for the routes to create the actions.
The front-end is built in scss, javascript ( spaghetti version ) and git. And alot of coffee.
