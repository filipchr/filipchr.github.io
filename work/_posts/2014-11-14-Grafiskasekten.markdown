#December 2013
The students @ Grafisk form och kommunikation, Södra Vätterbygdens Folkhögskola is to host a final exhibition for the public in Jönköping.
But they need a website for the event.

As i felt that I was most comfortable with the code in my coding, I got the privilege to create the website.

The theme of the exhibition was 'the end is near' and we were inspired by cult movement. We wanted to capture the public and tickle their senses.
with pictures with no facial expressions, and a video background to get more depth the site were launched.

At the day of the exibition there were close 300 people presant.

The page is built opon Wordpress for the back-end, and custom javascript and scss for the front-end.
