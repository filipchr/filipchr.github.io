How can we as creatives use our knowledge for something good?
Well, my classmates and I doneted 24h for Hela Människan in Jönköping.
We did all from striping cars to a new website, all under 24h.

My role was to develop the new website together with 4 more lads. And it was the most terrifying, joyfull and tiresome 24h I've experianced!

Well, the breif were to create a website that was as good as if it were made by an experianced agency. And I think that we did succed with that!

The site is build upon Wordpress for the backend. The front-end is mainly built opon foundation, and then customized by hand to fit the need.
